# Machine Learning Data Management Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning (ML) tutorials and projects focused on various essential aspects of data management within ML workflows. Each project explores a different technique for organizing, tracking, and versioning data effectively, providing foundational skills for building robust ML systems.

## Projects Overview

1. **compare-data-formats**: A project that examines and compares the performance of different data formats (such as CSV, JSON, and Parquet) commonly used in ML workflows. This project demonstrates how data format choices can impact the efficiency of data processing in machine learning applications.

2. **data-versioning**: An introduction to data versioning using DVC (Data Version Control), a tool designed for managing large datasets in ML projects. This tutorial covers the basics of setting up DVC, tracking datasets, and integrating data versioning into the machine learning workflow to ensure reproducibility and ease of collaboration.

3. **data-versioning-pipeline**: Building on the data versioning tutorial, this project introduces DVC's pipeline capabilities. Here, youâ€™ll learn how to structure machine learning workflows into sequential stages, enabling automated tracking of dependencies and facilitating the re-execution of stages whenever data or code changes.

4. **feature-store**: A tutorial on using Feast, an open-source feature store for ML, to manage and retrieve features for models. This project illustrates how to use feature stores to centralize and standardize features across projects, improving consistency, enabling reuse, and streamlining feature engineering in ML pipelines.

Each project offers hands-on experience with essential data management tools and best practices, empowering you to develop reproducible, efficient, and scalable machine learning workflows.
