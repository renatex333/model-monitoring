# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of machine learning (ML) tutorials and projects designed to explore various concepts essential for building, monitoring, and managing ML workflows effectively. Each project focuses on a different aspect of machine learning operations (MLOps) and development best practices.

## Projects Overview

1. **documentation-tutorial**: A tutorial on creating high-quality documentation using Sphinx, emphasizing the importance of clear documentation in ML projects.

2. **logging-tutorial**: A guide to implementing effective logging in Python-based ML applications, covering logging best practices for debugging, error tracking, and system monitoring.

3. **ml-model-monitoring**: A project that demonstrates how to monitor machine learning models in production, including techniques for tracking model performance, detecting data drift, and maintaining model accuracy over time.

4. **tracking-tutorial**: A tutorial on using MLflow to track machine learning experiments, log parameters, metrics, and artifacts, and manage the lifecycle of ML models.

Each project is designed to offer hands-on experience with key MLOps tools and practices, helping you build robust and maintainable ML systems.
